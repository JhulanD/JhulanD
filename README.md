# 👨‍💻 Learning in Public — The CodeJD Journey

Hey, I’m Jhulan — you might know me online as **CodeJD**.

This repo (`JhulanD`) is not a portfolio — it’s my **code journal**. After years of building with Webflow and Framer, I decided to go back to the basics and learn front-end development from scratch.

No templates. No frameworks. Just raw HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and curiosity.

## ✨ What I’ve Built So Far

### 🧱 My First Portfolio — Built from Scratch  
> “No templates. No frameworks. Just me, VS Code, and two weekends.”

This was my first real HTML & CSS project where I wrote every line myself.  
- I structured the layout using semantic HTML tags and styled it with clean CSS.  
- Learned about spacing, padding, responsive sections, and Sora font integration.  
- The site includes an intro, work showcase, and contact section.  
- Deployed via **Netlify** — which made going live feel magical.

### 🧪 Google Homepage Clone — Rebuilding a Classic  
> “Every `<div>`, `<input>`, `<class>` felt like a mini-masterclass.”

I challenged myself to recreate Google.com using just HTML & CSS:  
- Used `position`, `margin`, `padding`, and flexbox to align elements.  
- Styled the search bar, buttons, footer, and minimal branding elements.  
- Made it pixel-close without using any frameworks.  
- This helped me deeply understand layout and browser rendering.

### 🎯 Flexbox Mini Projects — CSS in Action  
> “Flexbox helped structure things. Absolute positioning brought balance.”

Built 3 small landing-page style UIs using only HTML & CSS:  
- Practiced vertical text scrolling using animations.  
- Added image overlays for text contrast.  
- Learned how to center content with `justify-content` and `align-items`.  
- Used `z-index`, `position: absolute`, and responsive media queries.

These projects were based on starter tasks from **Sheryians Coding School**.

### 📘 Meta Front-End Dev Course — My First Certification  
> “It’s a small milestone, but one that reflects the discipline and passion it takes to grow in this field.”

I completed Meta’s **Introduction to Front-End Development** course on Coursera.  
It helped clarify key concepts:
- How the web works (HTML/CSS/JS basics)
- File structuring, browser rendering, and accessibility
- Version control with Git & GitHub
- Developer tools and a roadmap for future learning

### 🧰 Learning HTML All Over Again — 20 Years Later  
> “I started with Dreamweaver 20 years ago. Now I’m learning HTML like it’s brand new.”

I completed a YouTube tutorial titled **HTML Full Course – Web Development for Beginners** (James McArthur).  
Even though it was 2.5 hours long, I took two days to go through it, pausing to code along with each topic.

- Built small sections after every lesson
- Learned about tags, nesting, accessibility, form fields
- Made a basic multi-section landing page

## 💬 Why This Repo Exists

This isn’t a showcase. It’s a **public logbook** of my transition from no-code to real code.

Every project here is a building block toward becoming a front-end developer.  
I believe in learning in public — and in keeping things real, messy, and human.
